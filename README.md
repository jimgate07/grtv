# Twitch and Dailymotion to m3u8

*[as the name says: [some] streaming links to HLS (HTTP Live Streaming)]*

# How does it work?
First of all, I originally took the user code from https://github.com/azgaresncf/strm2hls, and then I added some more "channels".

# Can I make contribrutions?
Of course you can! Just make sure that your channel isn't inappropriate (NSFW). 

You can do either a simple issue or even a pull request if you feel like it.
